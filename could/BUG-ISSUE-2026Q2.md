## ISSUE:bug 2026-06-09 18:03 → 5 additional production risks: insight upsert P2002 unhandled, JWT expiry not checked on password reset, concurrent list cap bypass, JSON schema drift silent, CookRecord status transition allows re-start

**1. Insight upsert P2002 not caught (`insights.ts`):**
- `prisma.userInsight.upsert` on `@@unique([userId, category])` can throw P2002 under concurrent execution (two parallel recipe saves for the same user). No try/catch exists around the upsert — the error propagates as an unhandled promise rejection, causing the recipe save to return 500.

**2. JWT not re-verified on password reset form submit:**
- `POST /auth/reset-password-form` receives `token` from form body and injects it into the response HTML. The token is validated for DB existence but if JWT expiry validation is skipped at the form-submit stage (vs. form-display stage), an expired token in a cached browser form can be submitted and accepted after the 1-hour window.

**3. Concurrent list creation bypasses 5-list cap:**
- `POST /lists` checks `count < 5` then creates a new list. Under concurrent requests (mobile client double-tap or network retry), two requests can both pass the count check before either inserts — result: 6+ lists created, exceeding the cap. No DB-level constraint enforces the 5-list limit.

**4. JSON column schema drift goes undetected:**
- `CookRecord.ingredients`, `UserInsight.data`, `FlowStep.content`, and `UserFlowView.responses` are all `Json` columns. If the AI service changes its output format (e.g., flattens a nested object), old and new data coexist in the same column with no validation or migration. Parsing code that expects the old shape will silently fail or return undefined fields.

**5. CookRecord allows re-starting a completed session:**
- `POST /records/start` creates a new record tied to a `recipeId`. There is no check for an existing `STARTED` or `COMPLETED` record for the same `userId + recipeId`. A user can start the same recipe multiple times in parallel, inflating cook session counts and potentially triggering duplicate insight analysis runs.
## ISSUE:bug 2026-06-07 16:30 → 6 production bug risks: unawaited placeholder init, Apple JWKS no cache, rate-limit race, HTML injection, missing email cascade, stemMatch false positives

**1. Unawaited `initPlaceholder()` (recipes route startup):**
- `initPlaceholder()` is called but not awaited at module load time. If canvas initialization takes time, the first recipe OG image request before the placeholder is ready returns null. Race condition at startup.

**2. Apple JWKS fetch on every auth call:**
- `POST /auth/apple` fetches `https://appleid.apple.com/auth/keys` on every request with no caching. Under concurrent Apple sign-ins, this fires N simultaneous external HTTP requests. If Apple throttles or returns 429, all concurrent sign-ins fail simultaneously.

**3. Rate limit INCR/EXPIRE race condition (`rateLimit.ts` lines ~70–72):**
- `redis.incr(key)` followed by a conditional `redis.expire(key, 3600)` only if `count === 1`. Under concurrent requests, two requests can both see `count === 1` before either sets the expiry — the key then never expires and permanently blocks the user. Should use a Lua script or `SET NX EX` atomic operation.

**4. HTML injection in password reset form (`auth.ts`):**
- `reset-password-form` POST handler injects `${token ?? ""}` directly into HTML response without escaping. A malformed token containing `<script>` would execute in the browser. The token is from the request body (not DB-validated at that point), so this is an XSS vector.

**5. EmailVerification token not cleaned up on user delete:**
- `DELETE /users/me` manually deletes `emailVerificationToken` but does NOT check if there are `DietaryPreference` records with a cascade issue — actually it does delete them. However, if a user has an active `EmailVerificationToken` that was already consumed but the row wasn't deleted (edge case), the delete will fail with a FK constraint.

**6. `stemMatch` false positives in pantry matching:**
- `pluralStem()` in `cookRecords.ts` is a naive plural stripper. "tomatoes" → "tomato" works, but "eggs" → "eg", "peas" → "pea", "cheese" → "chees". These stems can cross-match unrelated ingredients (e.g., "chees" matches "cheesecake"), causing incorrect pantry/grocery categorization in cook records.
