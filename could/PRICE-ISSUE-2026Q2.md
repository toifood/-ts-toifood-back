## ISSUE:backend 2026-06-22 20:06 -> No IAP receipt validation path exists; admin role implicitly grants premium; continent preferences silently absent for free users

**1. No in-app purchase validation endpoint**
`src/services/appstore.ts` uses the App Store Connect API only for analytics metrics — there is no endpoint that validates a StoreKit receipt or Server Notification and upgrades `User.role` to `premium`. The same is true for Play Store: `playstore.ts` only queries crash/ANR rates. Premium role assignment has no automated path and must be set directly in the database. A paying customer cannot self-serve a role upgrade.

**2. `admin` role implicitly grants all premium benefits**
`src/middleware/rateLimit.ts:2787`: `if (role === "admin") { next(); return; }` bypasses all rate limits. `src/routes/users.ts:1540`: `isPremium: user.role !== "free"` — admin users appear as premium to the client. If an admin account is compromised, the attacker receives unlimited generation and premium UX. Explicitly checking `role === "premium" || role === "admin"` only in the rate-limit bypass (not in `isPremium`) would allow separating the two concerns.

**3. Continent preferences are silently ignored for Ollama (free-tier default)**
`src/routes/recipes.ts:215`: `const continentPreferences = provider === "claude" ? (user?.continentPreferences ?? []) : []`. Free users generating with Ollama never have their cuisine preferences applied, even if they have set them. The response gives no indication that the preference was ignored — the `continent` field in the response reflects what Ollama randomly selected, not the user's preference.
## ISSUE:price 2026-06-22 11:51 → YouTube API quota risk: every generate + save fires a search unit; OG images bloat Postgres

**YouTube quota burn**: `findRecipeVideo` is called in `POST /recipes/generate` unconditionally (no key-absent guard beyond a warn + null return), and again in `POST /recipes` (save) unless `clientVideoId` is passed. YouTube Data API v3 search costs 100 quota units per call; the free tier is 10,000 units/day — 100 generate calls/day exhausts the quota. The generate and save responses already pass `videoId` to the client, so the save re-fetch is redundant if the client always echoes it back. A quota monitor or server-side cache (keyed on recipe title) would reduce burn.

**OG images in PostgreSQL**: Recipe OG images are stored as `Bytes` in the `Recipe.ogImage` column. A 1200×630 PNG is ~200–500 KB each. At 1,000 saved recipes that's 200–500 MB of binary data in Postgres, not covered by any CDN or eviction policy. Recipes list queries (`GET /recipes`) do a `select` that excludes `ogImage`, which is good, but the column size still affects DB backup/restore cost and WAL overhead.

**GitHub API on every auth event**: Each login/register fires a GET + PUT to GitHub from `pushRowToGitHub`. Under auth load (e.g., 100 logins/minute) this creates 200 GitHub API calls/minute, consuming significant rate limit headroom and adding ~200–500 ms of network round-trip to every auth background job.

**Claude per-request cost**: At current `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` pricing (~$0.80/MTok input, ~$4/MTok output) and prompt size (~500–800 tokens in + ~300 tokens out), each Claude recipe generation costs ~$0.002. The premium limit of 5/hour per user is economically safe at current scale.

**No in-app purchase validation** — `src/services/appstore.ts` and `src/services/playstore.ts` fetch store metrics (installs, sessions, crashes) but do not validate purchase receipts. There is no App Store Server Notifications webhook endpoint and no Google Play Real-time Developer Notifications handler. Premium role must be granted by an admin via direct DB update or admin API — there is no automated upgrade path from a purchase event.

**Premium enforced only via rate limits** — In `src/routes/recipes.ts`, `isPremium` is computed as `user.role !== "free"` but is currently only used to pass `continentPreferences` to the Claude provider (line ~215). The actual premium gate is the rate limit difference: free gets 3 Ollama / 2 Claude per hour; premium gets 10 / 5. No other feature is currently gated on premium.

**`storeMetrics` endpoint is read-only and admin-gated** — `GET /store-metrics` (or `/1-1-1/api/store-metrics`) requires `requireAdmin`. It returns iOS and Android metrics with a 1-hour in-memory cache. This is useful for manual monitoring but does not feed back into role assignment.

**Rate limit values** (`src/middleware/rateLimit.ts`):
```
free:    { ollama: 3,   claude: 2  }
premium: { ollama: 10,  claude: 5  }
admin:   { ollama: 999, claude: 999 }
```
These are hardcoded — any change requires a redeploy. No configuration via env vars.
